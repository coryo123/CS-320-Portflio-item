How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  We could implement security testing and performance testing as a couple of testing techiniques that will ensure these functions. The performance 
testing would help to ensure that our software will be fucntinal under stress and high traffic, among other performance based situations. The security testing 
will make sure that we have secured the consumer data we are using and make sure that our software is safe from attacks.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  We interpret user needs by incorporating them with the software requirement laid out by the company. These requirements will make sure we meet the needs of the consumer
and then take feedback from the users to make the program more efficient.
How do I approach designing software?
  There are various ways to approach designing software, either throughou self teaching or a structured degree program. There aree multiple self taught programmers
who design software from the abudance of information laid out today. You can also do what I am doing now, which is join schopol and join a degree program tailed in software designing that you will be able to use in the future.
